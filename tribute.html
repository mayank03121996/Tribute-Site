          <p>The Chipko movement or chipko andolan, was a forest conservation movement in India.
             The movement originated in 1973 at the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand (then part of Uttar Pradesh) and went on to become a rallying point for many future environmental movements all over the world. 
             It created a precedent for starting nonviolent protest in India.
             However, it was Sunderlal Bahuguna, a Gandhian activist, who gave the movement a proper direction and its success meant that the world immediately took notice of this non-violent movement,
             which was to inspire in time many similar eco-groups by helping to slow down the rapid deforestation, expose vested interests, increase social awareness and the need to save trees, increase
             ecological awareness, and demonstrate the viability of people power.
             He used the slogan "Ecology is the permanent economy". Above all, it stirred up the existing civil society in India, which began to address the issues of tribal and marginalized people. 
             And it's true that the support for the movement came mainly from the womenfolk. The Chipko Andolan or the Chipko movement is a movement that practiced methods of Satyagraha where both male and female activists from Uttarakhand played vital roles, 
             including Gaura Devi, Suraksha Devi, Sudesha Devi, Bachni Devi and Chandi Prasad Bhatt, Virushka Devi and others.</p>
